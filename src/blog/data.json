The analogy we always used was one of history: Ethereum development practices are years behind the rest of the industry, and it's our job to build tools that modernize our craft. Well today, Truffle's come one step closer to that goal. We're happy to announce the release of our fully featured, fully portable Solidity debugger and debugging libraries."

From a single developer, we are now a team of five (soon to be even more), which means that we can spread the work around. As a new full-time member of the team, I've first taken to looking at our existing materials to ensure that everything is up-to-date and working well. For example, our website, a public GitHub repository, had been receiving pull requests (PRs) for the better part of a year, and they had been languishing for want of someone to go through them.",

    "excerpt": "When users begin developing on Ethereum, the first question they ask is, \"Where do I start?\". In the past, there hasn't been an easy answer: the answer generally consisted of many flavors of \"it depends\", and usually led to an investigation of what the user was trying to build, a general overview of their development skills, their knowledge of Ethereum, and the libraries and tools they're already most comfortable with. When determining how the Truffle team can help in this process, it quickly became apparent that what our users needed were examples. Many of them. So, being the upstanding community members we are, we set out to create those example, and today, we're happy to show you what we've accomplished."
